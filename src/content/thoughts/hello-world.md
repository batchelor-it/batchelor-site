Every few years I get the itch to own my own space on the internet a little more intentionally. This time I actually did something about it.

This site is built with Astro, hosted on Cloudflare Pages, and connected to a GitHub repo. No WordPress, no Adobe Portfolio, no monthly subscription to something I half-use. Just files, Git, and a domain I already owned.

I'll use this space to write about IT, document projects, share photos, and occasionally ramble about whatever I'm tinkering with. No schedule, no pressure.

If you're reading this - hi. Hope you find something useful here.
