      <p>
        I grew up in Northeast Georgia and Western North Carolina before packing up and moving to New Zealand in my early twenties - what started as an adventure turned into something much bigger. I met my wife, became a stepdad to two incredible kids, and found my footing in a career I genuinely love.
      </p>
      <p>
        My path into IT wasn't exactly planned, but once I got my foot in the door I never looked back. I've spent the better part of a decade bridging the gap between technology and the people who use it - whether that's migrating thousands of devices, building technical communities, or just making sure someone's laptop works before an important meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        After years in New Zealand, we made the move back to the States and landed in Austin for a while before eventually making our way back to Georgia. Life has a funny way of coming full circle.
      </p>
        <p>
        Outside of work I'm usually tinkering with something on my home lab, gaming, crouched in a field with a camera pointed at a bird that definitely already flew away, or occasionally on a trail with Luna when the weather plays nice.
